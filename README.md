# 🌍 Methane Emissions Analysis with Python

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis on global methane emissions using the IEA dataset. It leverages **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to explore regional and sector-wise emissions, identify top sources, visualize trends, and propose targeted solutions for reducing methane output.

## 📊 Features

- Clean and process methane emissions data using `pandas`
- Analyze emissions by:
  - Region
  - Sector (e.g., Energy, Agriculture, Waste)
  - Year (baseYear trend)
- Visualizations:
  - Pie Chart: Emissions by type
  - Bar Chart: Top emitting countries/regions
  - Line Plot: Emission trend over years
  - Heatmap: Region vs Sector-wise emissions
  - Scatter Plot: Emissions by source

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` – for data manipulation and grouping  
- `numpy` – for numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` – for generating all visualizations

## 📌 Insights

- Asia Pacific leads emissions in both **Energy** and **Agriculture**  
- North America and Russia show high **Energy sector** emissions  
- Waste-related emissions are prominent in **Europe** and **Asia**  
- Emissions have been rising unevenly over the years  

---

## ✅ Suggested Mitigation Strategies

- Implement methane leak detection in top emitting countries  
- Promote landfill gas capture and improved waste management  
- Encourage low-emission farming and livestock practices  
- Upgrade oil and gas infrastructure, especially in older regions
