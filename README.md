# 🌍 Methane Emissions Analysis with Python

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis on global methane emissions using the IEA dataset. It leverages **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to explore regional and sector-wise emissions, identify top sources, visualize trends, and propose targeted solutions for reducing methane output.

## 📊 Features

- Clean and process methane emissions data using `pandas`
- Analyze emissions by:
  - Region
  - Sector (e.g., Energy, Agriculture, Waste)
  - Year (baseYear trend)
- Visualizations:
  - Pie Chart: Emissions by type
  - Bar Chart: Top emitting countries/regions
  - Line Plot: Emission trend over years
  - Heatmap: Region vs Sector-wise emissions
  - Scatter Plot: Emissions by source
